# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed. 
If it's your first time contributing to open source please don't hesitate and just open a Pull Request. 
Your suggestion/fix isn't stupid, I'll make sure I explain what's wrong with your PR if it wasn't accepted.

## Here are some points to consider:

- Your PR must be making only a single change, 
if you want to suggest multiple features or fix multiple issues please open separate PRs.
- If you have an idea that will require a lot of work, make sure you suggest it in a new [issue](https://github.com/DoedeJaarsmaCommunicatie/DJC_Extending_Elementor/issues) first to make sure it's admired before investing time into it.
- Pull Requests that don't have a clear explanation of what it does will be closed.
- Keep your code clean. Clean means you're proud of how it turned out.
